## Why Another Gantt Library

I've looked into several libraries, both proprietary and free software, and they either are too expensive for the 
I need to use a Gantt chart or have licenses that make it difficult to use in proprietary projects, or don't offer the 
features I need.

One of the best Gantt components I've found is Oracle JET Gantt, unfortunately it requires me to build a full OJET 
based SPA application and integration those into non SPA, or simple HTML/CSS + JS projects (no UI or APP frameworks) 
takes more time (and effort) than it should.

The second-best Gantt component is jQueryGantt, that I've forked to build this project, with the following 
requirements/goals:

- Simple to use and integrate into HTML, CSS and JavaScript projects that don't use frameworks (currently, kGantt 
still depends on jQuery);
- Free software that offers a good set of base features;
- Prefer vanilla JavaScript, with as little dependencies as possible;

## Original Project

Based on jQueryGantt, a jQuery based Gantt editor written by Roberto Bicchierai and Silvia Chelazzi, part of the
[Twproject](https://twproject.com), with code available at https://github.com/robicch/jQueryGantt.

These are some key features from jQueryGantt that are still true in kGantt:

* jQuery based 3.2
* MIT licensed: you can reuse everywhere https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
* JSON import-export
* internationalizable
* manage task status â€“> project workflow
* manage dependencies
* manage assignments (resources, roles efforts)
* server synchronization ready
* full undo-redo support
* cross browser (at least for recent versions)
* keyboard editing support
* SVG visual editor
* print friendly
* collapsible branches
* critical path
* milestones, progress etc.
* zoom
